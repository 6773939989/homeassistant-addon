## Pre-Alpha! Expect things to change

This is in pre-alpha experimental phase and expect API:s to change over time. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet PR:s.

Only amd64 (non arm) is currently supported but ARM devices as Raspberry PI will be supported in the near future.

The daemon is currently only distributed through Hassio add-on but a docker container and instruction to run locally will be provided in time.
