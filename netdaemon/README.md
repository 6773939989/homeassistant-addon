# NetDaemon

This is the application daemon project for Home Assistant. This project makes it possible to make automations using the .NET 5.

Why a new application daemon for Home Assistant? There already exists one!? The existing appdaemon is a great software and are using python as language and ecosystem. This is for people who loves to code in the .NET core ecosystem and c#. The daemon will be supported by all supported platforms of .NET core.

## Dev environment

## Beta

This is in beta phase and the API:s getting more stable but there could still be breaking changes!. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet PR:s.
