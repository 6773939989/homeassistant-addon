# NetDaemon V2

NetDaemon provides capability to write home automations in C# for Home Assistant. NetDaemon V2 is the current release of NetDaemon runtime. We do recommend moving to version 3. We will continue maintain and fixing bugs but no new features will be added to version 2. See the [docs](https://netdaemon.xyz) what's the difference is between the versions.
