# NetDaemon old .NET 3 release (DEPRECATED!!!)

This is the old 3.1 release of NetDaemon. The official version of the add-on is recommended for production use. If you want to use or test the latest dev release you can use this add-on instead of the official one.

Uninstall and re-install to uppdate to latest dev release.

## Dev environment

To setup a development environment for NetDaemon please see [https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template/tree/dot_net_5](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template/tree/dot_net_5). Please advice the .NET 5 version is it's own `dot_net_5` branch.

The NetDaemon project can be found at [https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon)

## Alpha

The .NET 5 version is in alpa-phase and the API:s getting more stable but there could still be breaking changes!. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet PR:s.

The daemon is currently only distributed through Home Assistant add-on and as a stand-alone docker container.
